## General Information
- ***LendingClub*** is an online platform/market-place which connects people seeking loans to financial investors. This case study aims to analyse the relevant data collected by the platform of all the borrowers/loan applicants.

- The ***Lending Club Case Study*** aims to use various ***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*** methods to analyse the loan data collected by the LendingClub platform to gain insights and identify the important features/variables that may determine ***loan defaulters*** so that these findings may be used to try and ***minimise the financial risks/losses*** for future loan sanctions.

- The data used for this case study contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011

## Conclusions
- ***Annual Income*** - Borrowers having a lower income range may result in defaulting on a loan.

- ***Employment Length*** - Borrowers with employment tenure as 10 years or more have resulted in more charged off loans. Additional data needs to be sourced and analysed to identify the reasoning.

- ***Loan Purpose*** - Loans for small businesses and debt consolidation purposes have resulted in a high number of charged off loans.

- ***Address State*** - Borrowers from specific states such as 'California', 'New york', 'Florida' and 'Texas' states are defaulted more as compared to other state residents. This could be the result of these being expensive cities and the associated higher cost of living.

- ***Debt-to-Income Ratio*** - Borrowers with a higher DTI i.e., higher debt to income ratio tended to result in more charged off loans.

- ***Loan Term*** - Longer loan terms show a higher rate of loan defaults.

- ***Loan Grades*** - Loans grade 'E' onwards have a tendency to be charged off more. As the grade and subgrade increased the percentage of loans charged off also increased.

- ***Funded Loan Amount*** - Higher funded loan amount results in higher risk of defaultinng on a loan. The risk of defaulting on a loan increases if the loan amount is more than 30% of Borrower's annual income.

- ***Interest Rate*** - Higher interest rates result in higher risk of loan defaults.

- ***Installment Amount*** - Loans with a higher Installment amount have a tendency of resulting in a default.
